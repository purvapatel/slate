# Introduction

The purpose of this API is to enable Supply Partners to integrate Thumbtack leads into their customer
acquisition workflows. This is accomplished by supporting two functions - **(1) lead transfer** and
**(2) two way messaging**. To support lead transfer, the Supply Partner will expose an API endpoint that
Thumbtack will call. To support two way messaging, both Thumbtack and the Supply Partner will expose
API endpoints for the other party to call.

Your use of our API is subject to Thumbtack's <a href='#api-terms-of-use'>API Terms of Use</a>.

# Authentication

## STEP 1: Connect Thumbtack account with Partner
> Sample URL

```
https://thumbtack.com/services/partner-connect/?client_id=THUMBTACK%20INTERNAL&redirect_uri=http://redirect.thumbtack.com&response_type=code&scope=messages
```

Use the consumer key as a client_ID that Thumbtack provided to you to request an AuthCode. Also, include the redirect_url so that  Thumbtack knows where to redirect users after they authorize access to their data.

`https://thumbtack.com/services/partner-connect/?client_id=<CLIENT_ID>&redirect_uri=<REDIRECT_URL>&response_type=code&scope=<SCOPE>`

### Expected Parameters in the URL

Parameter | Type | Description | Required
--------- | ---- | ----------- | --------
client_id | string | Consumer key provided by Thumbtack | Y
scope | string | Authorization scopes allow to access specific information from Thumbtack. Pass “messages” here | Y
redirect_uri | string | Thumbtack redirects Pro to this URL after they authorization | N
response_type | string | Must contain string `code` as a response type | Y
state | string | Client can insert state information that will be appended to the redirect_uri upon success user authorization | N

## STEP 2: Pro Authorizes Partner

Pro can select Thumbtack Business name from the dropdown and click on the “Confirm Connection” button to Authorize that partner.

## STEP 3: Authorization Code
> Sample URL when Redirect URL is https://redirect.thumbtack.com

```
https://redirect.thumbtack.com/?code=BnCICCQ9KWF6WXj_xtiN3A
```

After confirms the connection, There are two ways client will receive auth-code:

* If client send `redirect_uri` in the URL(step-1), then Thumbtack redirects the pro to a third-party URL with the authorization code in the URL. Redirection URL will look like below:

`<REDIRECT_URL>/?code=<AUTHORIZATION_CODE>&scope=messages
`

* If Client does not send `redirect_uri` in the URL(step-1), then client will see auth code like below.

### Expected Parameters in the URL
Parameter | Type | Description 
--------- | ---- | ----------- 
code | string | Authorization code appended to redirect_url in the previous step

Grab the Authorization Code and follow the below steps to get the Access Token.

   "token_type": "bearer",
   "expires_in": 3600,
   "refresh_token": "_s3cnwGAb5VgBt-CmYFSOw"
}
```

Once the pro authorizes access, the user is redirected back to the URL with the authorization code. This API will use authorization code in request return access token and refresh token in response.

### Request Endpoint

`POST https://pro-api.thumbtack.com/v2/tokens/access`

### Request Header

`Authorization: Basic <B64-encoded_oauth_credentials>`

The `Authorization: Basic` authorization header is generated through a Base64 encoding of `<client_id>:<client_secret>`.
You can use https://www.base64encode.org/ to see how headers should be encoded.

### Expected Request Params

Parameter | Type | Description | Required
--------- | ---- | ----------- | --------

--header 'Authorization: Basic VEhVTUJUQUNLIElOVEVSTkFMOlp4UnFMbnZZQUMzSERqVFlkem9sdFEK='
```

> Sample Response

```
{
   "access_token": "1.eyJCdXNpbmVzc1BLIjozMTQxNDgwOTYyOTIxODQyNDMsIkNsaWVudElEIjoiVEhVTUJUQUNLIElOVEVSTkFMIiwiU2NvcGUiOltdLCJFeHBpcmVzQXQiOiIyMDIxLTEwLTE0VDAyOjQ1OjA2LjI4NjUwNzkxOFoiLCJTcmNBdXRoQ29kZSI6ImIzYzUzNjk3ZGU0ZTlmNWQxNTk2NDhmMGM2MTc3YWRhZTNiMGM0NDI5OGZjMWMxNDlhZmJmNGM4OTk2ZmI5MjQyN2FlNDFlNDY0OWI5MzRjYTQ5NTk5MWI3ODUyYjg1NSJ9.tgDkhV1ooM1C7UjWhZ_mCXbzF11YH4NgsweJdfvG-f8",
   "token_type": "bearer",
   "expires_in": 3600,
   "refresh_token": "eoZNGASGdTWop1jINi-ouQ"
}
```

When Access Token expires, use the below API with refresh token which has a long lifetime, to get a new access token and refresh token pair.
### Request Endpoint

`POST https://pro-api.thumbtack.com/v2/tokens/access`

### Request Header

`Authorization: Basic <B64-encoded_oauth_credentials>`

The `Authorization: Basic` authorization header is generated through a Base64 encoding of `<client_id>:<client_secret>`.
You can use https://www.base64encode.org/ to see how headers should be encoded.

### Expected Request Params

Parameter | Type | Description | Required
--------- | ---- | ----------- | --------
grant_type | string | Must contain string `refresh_token` as a grant type | Y
refresh_token | string | Refresh Token value that you received along with the access token in step:4 | Y
token_type | string | Must contain string `REFRESH` as a token type | Y

expires_in | number | Access Token lifetime in seconds. Default expiry is `3600` seconds (1 hour).  | Y
refresh_token | string | The refresh token issued by the authorization server | Y

### Error handling with grace period 
We have implemented a grace period logic in OAuth refresh token flow to handle Network errors, Time-out errors or similar one.
If you receive `null` in the response to `/tokens/access` API at the time of refreshing the token,
we encourage Partners to implement the retry logic on their side which will call `/tokens/access` API with same refresh token to get the valid response.
<span style="color:Green">***Grace period time - 10 sec***</span>

# Thumbtack Endpoints

Thumbtack will expose the following endpoints to Partners.
All endpoints should be versioned to support future schema changes.
Endpoints will use HTTP basic authentication, and Thumbtack will provide
Partners with username and password for Partners to call these endpoints.
Note that passing in the `Content-Type` header is required.

# Development Guide

Please follow the steps outlined in this section to integrate with Thumbtack's API.

*Note that in order to call Thumbtack's test endpoints, Partners will need test credentials (username + password).
Please <a href='#contact-us'>contact us</a> and we will get you set up with the appropriate test credentials.*

## Build Partner Endpoints

The first step is to build the endpoints outlined in the <a href='#partner-endpoints'>Partner Endpoints</a> section.

Thumbtack supports both a test and production environment, so we recommend Partners to build both test and production
endpoints as well. At a minimum, it is recommended that Partners test their endpoints by calling them (using `curl` or
any similar tool) and validating that the endpoints return a successful `HTTP 200` response.

The purpose of this is to ensure that the Partner endpoints can accept the payloads Thumbtack will provide.
Feel free to use the sample request bodies provided throughout this guide to simulate the payloads Thumbtack will provide.

> Sample Request

```shell
curl -X POST https://staging-pro-api.thumbtack.com/v1/test/create-lead
    -H 'Content-Type:application/json'
    --user '<thumbtack_username>:<thumbtack_password>'
    -d '{
        "businessID": <business_id>
    }'
```

Once you have successfully created your endpoints, the next step is to test calling
<a href='#messages'>Thumbtack's messages endpoint.</a>.

In order to do this, you will need to provide a valid `businessID` and `leadID`. By valid, we mean the `businessID`
and `leadID` need to exist on Thumbtack. Thus, the Partner needs to create a dummy business and lead on Thumbtack's
test environment.

To do this, we have provided an endpoint Partners can call to generate this dummy data.

### HTTP Endpoint

`POST https://staging-pro-api.thumbtack.com/v1/test/create-lead`

Calling this endpoint will create a dummy business and lead on Thumbtack's test environment.
On the right, we've provided a sample request and response. Note that passing in the `Content-Type` header is required.

**Note**: For the sample request, the `businessID` field is optional (although if you have been provided a `businessID`,
it's recommended you provide it in the request. However, if you don't have a `businessID` you must provide an empty
data payload.

## Test Thumbtack Messaging Endpoint

Now that you've generated dummy data on Thumbtack's test environment, you should be able to test calling Thumbtack's
messages endpoint.

Take the `businessID` and `leadID` that were returned from calling `https://staging-pro-api.thumbtack.com/v1/test/create-lead`
and construct the appropriate Thumbtack messages endpoint.

In our case `businessID` is `380497492389642246` and `leadID` is `380497493950742534` so our Thumbtack messages endpoint
would look like - `https://api.thumbtack.com/v1/business/380497492389642246/lead/380497493950742534/message`.

However, **because we want to run this on our test environment**, we want to use the `staging-pro-api` host instead of
the `api` host. Thus, the endpoint we want to call would be `https://staging-pro-api.thumbtack.com/v1/business/380497492389642246/lead/380497493950742534/message`.

Call this endpoint as detailed in the <a href='#messages'>Thumbtack's messages endpoint</a> section, and validate
that you get a `success` response.

## Go To Production

At this point, the Partner's endpoints have been validated to accept Thumbtack payloads and the Partner has been
able to successfully call Thumbtack's endpoint to send a message. The next step is to move the integration to
Production.

To do this, the Partner needs to <a href='#contact-us'>contact Thumbtack</a> to set up Production credentials
for the Partner's integration as well as inform Thumbtack about the Partner's endpoints. A Thumbtack representative
will walk through the final steps to getting the Partner integrated onto the Thumbtack production environment.

Once a Partner has been fully set up on Production, Thumbtack will start pinging the Partner's endpoints
when a Partner receives both leads and messages from Thumbtack customers. The Partner will be expected to ping
Thumbtack's messages endpoint when they want to respond to a Thumbtack customer.
